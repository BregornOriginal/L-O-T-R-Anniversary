# Lord Of The Ring Anniversary

> First Capstone for Microverse Bootcamp!
> I choose a topic about the Lord Of The Ring, and create a fictitious website of his Anniversary.

> I have this example to follow [DESIGN](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015).

This Capstone was made in 3 days. The next features are created.

In this case I will create the Home page and the About page for mobile (up to 768px wide) and Desktop (768px or wider) versions.

- Home page

- About page
 
✅ The home page has a link in the menu to the about page.

✅ The logo of the page (ring) links to the home page

***Mobile menu***

✅ The hamburger button when is clicked shows the menu over the page

✅ The mobile menu has a close button, that closes the menu

***Dynamic page***

✅ The section "Featured Actors" was created dynamically in JavaScript

✅ An object in JavaScript was created to store the information of the cars
