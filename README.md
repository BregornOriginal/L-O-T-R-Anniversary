# Microverse Bootcamp
## Capstone module 1

## I have this example to follow [DESIGN](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015).

### In this case I will create the Home page and the About page for mobile and desktop version.

### In each versions the design have to be similar like, layout, fonts and colors. But I can choose another topic.
